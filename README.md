# AR For Anatomy

Overview AR for Anatomy is a Unity3D project focused on providing an immersive learning experience in human anatomy through Augmented Reality (AR). The project includes features such as 3D models of body parts, rotation controls, scene transitions, and scrollable informational texts, enhancing the understanding of the human body.

## Features 3D Models: 
Explore detailed 3D models of various body parts. Experience learning in an enhanced way by studing 3D Models. 


## Usage:
1. Open the Unity project.
2. Run the project in the Unity Editor or build it for your target platform.

3. Navigate through the AR environment using the following controls:

### Rotation Controls:

Use the mouse to rotate and examine the 3D models of different body parts.
On touch devices, swipe gestures can be employed for the same effect.

### Scene Transitions:

Experience smooth transitions between anatomical scenes by interacting with designated triggers or buttons within the AR environment.

### Scrollable Texts:

Access detailed information about each displayed body part by interacting with on-screen UI elements.
Scroll through informative texts to learn more about anatomical structures and their functions.
### Interactive Learning:

Engage in an interactive learning experience that combines visual exploration with educational content.
Utilize the features provided to deepen your understanding of human anatomy.
